### **Project Description**

This project focuses on mastering Python decorators to enhance database operations in Python applications. Through hands-on tasks, learners will create custom decorators to log queries, handle connections, manage transactions, retry failed operations, and cache query results. The tasks are designed to simulate real-world challenges, providing learners with an in-depth understanding of Python’s capabilities for dynamic and reusable code in database management.

### **Learning Objectives**

By completing these tasks, professional developers will:

1.  **Deepen their knowledge of Python decorators** and how they can be used to create reusable, efficient, and clean code.
2.  **Enhance database management skills** by automating repetitive tasks like connection handling, logging, and caching.
3.  **Implement robust transaction management techniques** to ensure data integrity and handle errors gracefully.
4.  **Optimize database queries** by leveraging caching mechanisms to reduce redundant calls.
5.  **Build resilience into database operations** by implementing retry mechanisms for transient errors.
6.  **Apply best practices in database interaction** for scalable and maintainable Python applications.

### **Requirements**

1.  Python 3.8 or higher installed.
2.  SQLite3 database setup with a `users` table for testing.
3.  A working knowledge of Python decorators and database operations.
4.  Familiarity with Git and GitHub for project submission.
5.  Strong problem-solving skills and attention to detail.

### **Key Highlights**

1.  **Task 0: Logging Database Queries**
    
    *   Create a decorator to log all SQL queries executed by a function.  
        
    *   Learn to intercept function calls to enhance observability.
2.  **Task 1: Handle Database Connections with a Decorator**
    
    *   Automate database connection handling with a decorator.  
        
    *   Eliminate boilerplate code for opening and closing connections.
3.  **Task 2: Transaction Management Decorator**
    
    *   Implement a decorator to manage database transactions (commit/rollback).  
        
    *   Ensure robust error handling and data consistency.
4.  **Task 3: Retry Database Queries**
    
    *   Build a decorator to retry database operations on failure.  
        
    *   Introduce resilience against transient database issues.
5.  **Task 4: Cache Database Queries**
    
    *   Implement a decorator to cache query results.  
        
    *   Optimize performance by avoiding redundant database calls.
