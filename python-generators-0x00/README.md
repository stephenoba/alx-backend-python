#### **About the Project**

This project introduces advanced usage of Python generators to efficiently handle large datasets, process data in batches, and simulate real-world scenarios involving live updates and memory-efficient computations. The tasks focus on leveraging Python’s `yield` keyword to implement generators that provide iterative access to data, promoting optimal resource utilization, and improving performance in data-driven applications.

#### **Learning Objectives**

By completing this project, you will:

1.  **Master Python Generators**: Learn to create and utilize generators for iterative data processing, enabling memory-efficient operations.
2.  **Handle Large Datasets**: Implement batch processing and lazy loading to work with extensive datasets without overloading memory.
3.  **Simulate Real-world Scenarios**: Develop solutions to simulate live data updates and apply them to streaming contexts.
4.  **Optimize Performance**: Use generators to calculate aggregate functions like averages on large datasets, minimizing memory consumption.
5.  **Apply SQL Knowledge**: Use SQL queries to fetch data dynamically, integrating Python with databases for robust data management.

#### **Requirements**

1.  Proficiency in Python 3.x.
2.  Understanding of `yield` and Python’s generator functions.
3.  Familiarity with SQL and database operations (MySQL and SQLite).
4.  Basic knowledge of database schema design and data seeding.
5.  Ability to use Git and GitHub for version control and submission.
